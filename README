XML::Atom::SimpleFeed

This module provides a minimal API for generating Atom syndication feeds
quickly and easily. It supports all aspects of the Atom format, but has
no provisions for generating feeds with extension elements.

You can supply strings for most things, and the module will provide
useful defaults. When you want more control, you can provide data
structures, as documented, to specify more particulars.
